## Stock Market Trading Platform — Full-Stack DevOps Project

### 📌 Overview

This project is a **production-grade Stock Market Trading web application** built to demonstrate real-world **Full-Stack + Docker + CI/CD + Cloud deployment** capabilities.

The platform provides users with an interface to explore stock insights, and securely submit queries or contact information — backed by a fully containerized backend and modern DevOps workflows.

---

### 🎯 Project Goal

To create a **scalable, containerized, automated deployment system** demonstrating professional DevOps practices including:

* Containerized frontend and backend services
* Secure API communication
* Automated CI pipeline
* Cloud-ready architecture
* Real-world error handling and improvement iterations

This project also simulates a **DevOps internship-style challenge** where the application evolves through real debugging, architecture refinement, and secure deployment steps.

### ⚙️ Workflow Summary

The project follows an **industry-aligned CI workflow**:

1. **Source Push** — Code pushed to main branch
2. **CI Trigger** — Pipeline automatically starts
3. **Install & Build** — Both frontend & backend dependencies resolved and app packaged
4. **Containerization** — Services built into Docker images
5. **Security & Compliance** — Best practices enforced in pipeline & secrets used safely
6. **Release** — Updated images pushed to container registry
7. **Cloud Deploy Ready** — Artifacts prepared for deployment across environments

This ensures reproducible builds, traceability, and clean promotion to production.
